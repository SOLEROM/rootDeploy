Docker setup is configured to manage their projects efficiently. Key features include: 1. An Ubuntu base with essential tools, Python, and Docker CLI installed. 2. A user named 'user' with passwordless sudo access is set up inside the Docker container. 3. A custom script, `save_changes.sh`, is embedded within the Docker image, allowing changes to be saved directly from inside the container. 4. The Makefile manages Docker operations, including building images, running containers with optional GUI and GPU support, and cleaning up the environment. 5. Conditional volume mounting is implemented in the Makefile, allowing the user to optionally specify a path for volume mounting when starting the container. 6. The Docker environment supports dynamic configuration for different running setups, such as GUI support and GPU acceleration, based on parameters passed to the Makefile commands. 7. The `save_changes.sh` script is stored temporarily on the host during the Docker build process and then integrated into the Docker image to allow for internal Docker commands execution.
